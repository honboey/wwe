# WWE Champion Title Holder Statistics

## About the project

This is a data visualisation project using the statistics of all the past and current WWE Championship title holders. The final product can be read on its [dedicated Observable page](https://observablehq.com/@honboey/wwe).

The data from this project comes from:
* Wikipedia's [List of WWE Champions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_Champions)
* The People's Wrestling Website's (TPWW) [table of wrestler heights and weights](https://www.tpww.net/info/heightsweights/). TPPW describes the info as "generally the “billed” heights and weights of current and former WWE, AEW, Impact, NXT, ROH, WCW, ECW and some indie and international wrestlers."

The data is queried and manipulated with JavaScript. Data visualisations are made in [D3](https://d3js.org/).

This project is a personal project to explore JavaScript, D3 and data visualisations. It's audience is limited, I can't see anyone who would be interested in it other than the tiny crossovwr of data viz fans and pro wrestling fans. 

## Using the project

Playing with the data to come up with your own narratives, insights and visualisations is easy! There are two datasets:
* `wrestlerHeightAndWeight.js`
* `wweChampions.js`

`wrestlerHeightAndWeight.js` is an array of objects, with each object detailing the wrestler's name (`name`), height as an array of feet and inches (`height`) and weight in pounds (`weight`).

The file `wwwe.js` contains all the functions I have written query and  manipulate the two datasets.
