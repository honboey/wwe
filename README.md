# WWE Champion Title Holder Statistics

## About the project

This is a data visualisation project using the statistics of all the past and current WWE Champion title holders.

The data from this project comes from:
Wikipedia's list of WWE Champions
The People's Wrestling Website's (TPWW) table of wrestlers' height and weight

The data is queried and manipulated with JavaScript. Data visualisations are made in D3.

This project is a personal project for me to explore JavaScript, D3 and data visualisations. It's audience is limited, I can't see anyone who would be interested other than the tinybcrissovwr of data via and Pro wrestling fans. 

## Using the project

Playing with the data to come up with your own narratives, insights and visualisations is easy! There are two datasets:
A list of all WWE Championship holders
A list of all well-known wrestlers' heights and weights (TPPW describe it as " These are generally the “billed” heights and weights of current and former WWE, AEW, Impact, NXT, ROH, WCW, ECW and some indie and international wrestlers."
